- [mirantis.com: Introduction to Istio Ingress: The easy way to manage incoming Kubernetes app traffic](https://www.mirantis.com/blog/introduction-to-istio-ingress-the-easy-way-to-manage-incoming-kubernetes-app-traffic/) Leaving your cluster exposed can be risky. That's why you need Istio Ingress, which only exposes the part that handles incoming traffic & allows routing rules based on routes, headers, IP addresses and more.

- [octetz.com: Setting Up Pod Security Policies](https://octetz.com/docs/2018/2018-12-07-psp/) By default, Kubernetes allows anything capable of creating a Pod to run a fairly privileged container that can compromise a system. Pod Security Policies protect clusters from privileged pods by ensuring the requester is authorised.
- [infracloud.io: Kubernetes Pod Security Policies with Open Policy Agent](https://www.infracloud.io/kubernetes-pod-security-policies-opa/) In this blog post, you will learn about the Pod Security Policy admission controller. Then you will see how Open Policy Agent can implement Pod Security Policies.
